proxmox-firewall (1.2.0) trixie; urgency=medium

  * fix #6831: move conntrack statement to forward chain to avoid that
    conntracked flows that are routed by the PVE host to not get accepted.

  * vnet firewall: create chains in host table only if host-level firewall is
    enabled.

  * ip filter: restrict containers to use their specific IP, not the full
    CIDR network.

  * fix #6336: fix IP filter matching logic so that filters with empty nomatch
    sets can actually work.

  * fix #6107: add support for legacy ipset and alias names, i.e. those that
    do not include the explicit scope (dc or guest).

  * firewall: set auto-merge flag for ipsets to ensure that sets that contain
    overlapping IP ranges do not cause rules to be generated that are not
    accepted by nftables.

  * merge management ipset with local_network to avoid pitfall and to better
    align the behavior with the perl pve-firewall daemon.

proxmox-firewall (0.5.0) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * rules: allow vital ICMP(v6) types irregardless of any other rules, which
    is particularly for ICMPv6 related ones. This follows RFC 4890.

  * service: flush firewall rules on force disable to avoid a race condition
    where the nftables rule-set never gets flushed and persists after
    disabling.

  * update to newer proxmox-sys and proxmox-schema dependencies

  * conntrack: arp: move handling to guest chains in order to avoid affecting
    bridged host interfaces.

  * guest: match arp packets via 'meta' filter type to ensure that valid ARP
    packets encapsulated in VLAN frames get through, as with the 'ether' type
    ARP traffic inside VLANs always gets dropped.
